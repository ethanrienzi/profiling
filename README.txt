Purpose:

The provided program, along with the associated configuration file, is designed to create a CPU-intensive workload that serves as an ideal testbed for evaluating profilers. It allows for assessing the profilers' ability to accurately measure CPU usage, performance, and identify bottlenecks in various computational tasks.

The program reads configurations from the config.ini file, determining which CPU-intensive tasks to perform based on boolean flags. These tasks encompass searching for prime numbers, calculating factorials, generating Fibonacci sequences, performing matrix multiplication, exponentiation, hash calculations, bit manipulation, and custom CPU-intensive operations.

The goal is to analyze how profilers handle different computational scenarios, varying levels of workload intensity, and the impact of distinct computational tasks on CPU performance. By toggling configurations and adjusting parameters like the number of threads and loops, we can simulate different workloads to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of profiling tools in capturing CPU usage and identifying performance bottlenecks in both single and multi-threaded environments. This aids in assessing the robustness and effectiveness of profilers in providing meaningful insights for performance optimization.
